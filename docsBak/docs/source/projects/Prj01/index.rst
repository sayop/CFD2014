Computer Project #1
===================

1. Project description
----------------------

In this exercise you will generate an inviscid, 2-D computational grid around a modified NACA 00xx series airfoil in a channel. The thickness distribution of a modified NACA 00xx series airfoil is given by:

.. math::
   y(x) = \pm 5t [0.2969 \sqrt{x_{int}x} - 0.126 x_{int} x - 0.3516 (x_{int}x)^{2} + 0.2843(x_{int}x)^{3} - 0.1015 (x_{int}x)^{4}]
