Problem #1
----------

A one-sided finite difference expression for :math:`\left ( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right )_{i}` can be shown to be

.. math::
   \left ( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right )_{i} \approx \frac{3u_{i} - 4u_{i-1} + u_{i-2}}{2 \Delta x}

a) Write the leading term in the truncation error. Assume that the nodes are equally spaced.

b) What is the order of accuracy of this difference representation?
